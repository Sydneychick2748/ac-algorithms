1. Enroll in this [Udemy course](https://anniecannons.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/quiz/4990668#overview)
2. Watch the following two videos and write down 2-4 observations or questions for each one.
3. a. [The All Important Coding Interview](https://anniecannons.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/lecture/8533042#overview)
my observation of the video is that there are a few phases for the interview process first one is the contact phase which consist of talking to the recruiter, finding friend's to refer you and submitting your resume these things will consists of your work experience your side projects and your social contacts. The other is the interview phase which will consists of  a phone screening ,onsite interview and a take hone assessment with these they will see if you are a good cultural fit and can you really code 
   b. [Getting Better at Coding Questions](https://anniecannons.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/lecture/8533046#overview)
   My observation to this video is show ing you how to solve coding questions that get asked most of the time like fizz buzz and the Fibonacci series  and solve with a recurse solution. The will evaluate your coding ability by giving you take home assignments , pair programming at a computer and a whiteboard. Saying that we have to get better at whiteboard questions because company's like to use these.
